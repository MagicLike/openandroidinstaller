OpenAndroidInstaller will try to guide you as far as possible. These vendors include *Sony, Motorola, Xiaomi* and *OnePlus* among others.

Other phone vendors stops allowing to unlock the bootloader all together. There is nothing to be done if you didn't unlock your device in time. These vendors include *Huawei and LG* among others. Support for these vendors will always be very limited.
